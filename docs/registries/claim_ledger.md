# Claim Ledger (candidate placeholders)

## 1. Closure ladders / closure saturation
- Candidate: closure saturates; generic extensions prevent saturation. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_1.md:L3745)
- Candidate: closure stabilizes; closure + generic extension can be open-ended. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_1.md:L4000)

## 2. Induced empirical closure E_{τ,Π} and (approx) idempotence
- Candidate: layer-birth criterion via idempotence of E_{τ,Π}. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_1.md:L4120)
- Candidate: E_{τ,Π} is (approximately) idempotent in stable regimes. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L2839)

## 3. AUT+REV+ACC and affinity decomposition
- Candidate: REV (microreversibility) requirement for admissible dynamics. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L805)
- Candidate: ACC defines the antisymmetric edge log-ratio / forcing 1-form. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L808)
- Candidate: antisymmetric forcing 1-form has a standard decomposition under ACC. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L3005)

## 4. Arrow-of-time = path KL + data processing
- Candidate: true arrow-of-time = path KL divergence. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L580)
- Candidate: data processing implies coarse-graining cannot create irreversibility. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L896)

## 5. Protocol trap
- Candidate: protocol trap explained precisely (why P3 looked like it creates force). (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L683)
- Candidate: external schedules are unaccounted drive (protocol trap). (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L936)

## 6. Generic extension / forcing lemma
- Candidate: Cohen/forcing generic extensions add non-definable objects. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_1.md:L3030)
- Candidate: Theorem 18.1 (high-entropy internal degrees yield non-definable predicates). (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L451)
- Candidate: Exercise 18 physical forcing lemma. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_4.md:L369)

## 7. P1/P2 topology/spectral roles
- Candidate: P1/P2/P4 change spectral structure of the micro operator. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L98)
- Candidate: P1 is operator rewrite under AUT+ACC. (docs/knowledge-base/exercises_3.md:L1970)
