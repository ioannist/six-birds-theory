# Overrides Registry (later overrides earlier)

## Override 1
- Claim being overridden: P3 alone yields sustained arrow-of-time in autonomous systems.
- Canonical corrected claim: Under AUT+ACC, P3 alone does not yield sustained arrow-of-time unless P6 is on or an external schedule is supplied.

## Override 2
- Claim being overridden: Macro/coarse-grained irreversibility can be created by coarse-graining alone.
- Canonical corrected claim: Arrow-of-time is path-space KL; coarse-graining cannot create it (data processing).
