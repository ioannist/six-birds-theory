The work directly addresses the concept of irreversibility, a key component of path-space KL divergence, showing that it can significantly vary depending on the precision of the experimental instrument. By linking coarse-graining to information thermodynamics, the authors implicitly engage with the idea of a route mismatch (Signature F), as the observed process irreversibility is distinct from the fine-grained one. The study demonstrates that while the coarse-grained quantities are observation-dependent, they still satisfy the fundamental relations of thermodynamics, such as the second law inequality and fluctuation theorems. The core contribution is a rigorous, agent-centric derivation of an operational arrow of time, which is highly relevant to the path-space KL irreversibility signature. The abstract explicitly mentions that the coarse-graining operation is idempotent, directly matching Signature A.

The authors demonstrate that most stationary processes are dynamically irreversible, exhibiting a pervasive temporal asymmetry in their informational and computational properties.

This cycle-based structure directly realizes the concept of **graph cohomology (D)**, as the cycles form the basis of the first homology group ($H_1$) of the Markov graph, which is central to the query's ""H1"" component.

Furthermore, the comparison between the exact reconstruction and the lower bounds implies a route mismatch (Signature F), where the observable path statistics differ from the true underlying dynamics, a discrepancy the paper aims to resolve. The paper establishes a critical timescale for the stroboscopic measurements, beyond which only bounds can be obtained, highlighting the limits of inferring the full, reversible dynamics from partial, irreversible observations.",1.

time reversal KL data processing Markov chain,time reversal KL data processing Markov chain,4,Entropy production and Kullback-Leibler divergence between stationary trajectories of discrete systems,"Édgar Roldán, Juan M.R. Parrondo",2012,https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5613,C,Strong,"The paper quantifies the irreversibility of a stationary time series by using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the probability of a forward trajectory and the probability of its time-reversed counterpart. This KLD is explicitly shown to provide a lower bound for the total entropy production of the underlying physical process, a concept central to the signature of path-space KL irreversibility (C). The work introduces analytical and numerical techniques to estimate this KLD for stochastic dynamics with a finite number of states, which are essentially discrete-time Markov chains. The authors examine how closely the KLD approximates the true entropy production, depending on the degree of observation or coarse-graining of the system's degrees of freedom. This direct link between time-reversal, KLD, and entropy production in Markovian systems makes it a strong match for signature C. The paper does not appear to address the other highly specialized signatures such as nested idempotents, graph cohomology, or route mismatch.","1.

S. Mulry presents a categorical approach to defining and elucidating fixed point constructions in semantics. It moves beyond traditional methods involving specific domains and continuous functions, instead relying on the structure of strong monads and algebras to build general fixed point operators. The work is highly relevant to the search query as it directly connects monads, fixed points, and the concept of idempotence within category theory. Specifically, the paper's focus on an algebraic framework for fixed point operators aligns with signature E (generic extension/definability). Furthermore, the construction of a general fixed point operator from specific semantic settings suggests a link to signature B (dynamics-induced completion). The discussion of an idempotent element e in the context of the fixed point object also directly relates to signature A (nested idempotents). The paper's goal is to provide a general algebraic framework, which serves as a springboard for further investigations into other issues in semantics.","1.

reflective subcategory closure operator preorder,reflective subcategory closure operator preorder,1,Epireflective subcategories and formal closure operators,"Mathieu Duckerts-Antoine, Marino Gran, Zurab Janelidze",2017,https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08627,A,Weak,"This paper explores the relationship between $\mathcal{E}$-epireflective subcategories and formal closure operators within a general category $\mathcal{C}$. The central mathematical object, the closure operator, is fundamentally an idempotent operation, which provides a structural connection to the 'nested idempotents' signature (A). Specifically, a closure operator $C$ satisfies the property $C(C(X)) = C(X)$, meaning repeated application yields no further change, which is the definition of idempotency. The work adapts the classical notion of a closure operator on monomorphisms to one defined on a class of epimorphisms, demonstrating a classification of epireflective subcategories. While the paper's domain is pure category theory, far removed from dynamics or information theory, the core concept of an idempotent operator is a direct, albeit abstract, match for the structural requirement of signature A. The other signatures, which involve concepts like KL irreversibility and graph cohomology, are not addressed by this foundational algebraic work.","1.

The invariant is constructed using the Karoubi envelope (or idempotent completion) of the syntactic semigroup associated with the shift's language. The Karoubi envelope is a universal construction that ensures all idempotents split, directly addressing the signature of nested idempotents (A). By applying this categorical completion to an object derived from a dynamical system (the shift), the work demonstrates a clear instance of a dynamics-induced completion (B). The authors prove that this Karoubi envelope is, up to natural equivalence, an invariant of flow equivalence, which is a stronger result than previous invariants. Furthermore, they show that this invariant is the ""best possible syntactic invariant"" for flow equivalence of sofic shifts. The study establishes a deep connection between category theory, specifically idempotent completion, and the classification of dynamical systems.","1.

This construction directly relates to Signature A (nested idempotents) because closure operators are inherently idempotent, and the ""lifted"" operator $c^E$ is a new idempotent operator derived from an existing one $c$, creating a nested structure of idempotent operations. The process of defining a new operator $c^E$ from an existing $c$ via a reflective subcategory also aligns with Signature E (generic extension/definability), as it extends the closure property from one category to another. The work provides a formal, layered construction for these mathematical structures, which is conceptually similar to a hierarchy or tower, even if those specific terms are not used. The paper focuses on applications in topology, topological groups, and topological $\\ast$-algebras. The strong connection to idempotent operations and the layered construction of the operators make this a highly relevant result for the query.","1.
